##Fibre Closet

Fibre Closet is a small app designed to help me keep keep track of my ever-increasing collection of fibres and yarn used for knitting, crochet, weaving, felting, spinning etc. 

Initially the app will consist of the following:

- a detailed inventory to keep track of different types of yarn/fibre
- an inventory of notions
- an organised repository of pdf patterns
- a system to keep track of WIPs (works-in-progress)

Future ideas:

- stitch counter
- FO gallery
- ability to share FOs, WIPs, inventory items via social media

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
